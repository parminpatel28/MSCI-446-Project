# CSVs

This directory holds each dataframe we used to train our models with. We have 5 primary dataframes that we ran through 4 different models. If you navigate to /model-results, that directory will contain the results of each dataframe. This means you can view how each dataframe performed for each model, and its exact metrics relating to accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC_AUC.
